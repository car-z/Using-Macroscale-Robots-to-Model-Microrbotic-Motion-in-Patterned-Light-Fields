Part of my research project as an REU student at the University of Pennsylvania, Miskin Group the summer of 2024.  

Repo includes my Arduino code to control the macrorobot model of the Miskin Lab's novel microrobots. The macrorobot follows differential drive kinematics where the speed of each wheel is independent of each other and linearly proportional to the intensity of incident light directly above it.
