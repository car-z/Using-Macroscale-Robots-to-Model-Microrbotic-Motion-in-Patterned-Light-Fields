Highlighted component of my research project as an NSF REU intern at the University of Pennsylvania, Miskin Group, the summer of 2024.  

This embedded C++ firmware (Arduino) controlled an optically actuated differential-drive robot, integrating sensor inputs to enable navigation and obstacle avoidance. The macrorobot served as a scale model of the Miskin Lab’s microrobots, with each wheel’s speed independently controlled and linearly proportional to the intensity of incident light.
