Part of my research project as an REU student at the University of Pennsylvania, Miskin Group the summer of 2024.  

This Arduino C++ firmware programmed an optically controlled differential-drive microrobot, integrating sensor inputs for navigation and obstacle avoidance. This macrorobot models the Miskin Lab's novel microrobots, designed so that the speed of each wheel is independent of each other and linearly proportional to the intensity of incident light directly above it.
